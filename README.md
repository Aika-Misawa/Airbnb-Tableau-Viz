# Airbnb Data Visualization Dashboard

## Overview
Using the airbnb data from kaggle, key insights were summarized and made into a visualization dashboard on Tableau</b>

## Key Insights
### Avg Price Per Bedroom:
Looking at listings based on average number of bedrooms, we see that listings with more bedrooms tend to have a higher average price, with a notable increase as additional bedrooms are added.
### Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings
This metric looks at distribution of listings based on the number of bedrooms. From this, we can observe that there is a concentration of listings in the 1-bedroom category, but that it may be advantageous to list higher bedroom properties because of less competition but also substantial revenue potential.
### Price Per Zipcode (Map)
Mapped out trends based on geographical locations using zip codes. We can see a geographical overview of which areas command premium prices.
### Price Per Zipcode (Bar Graph)
Sorted from highest price per zipcode to lowest for an easier visualization of which areas are better to invest in when commanding a premium price to airbnb.
###Revenue for Year
Visualized the trend over the course of the year to identify high-performing months and seasonal patterns. From this we can see a trend wherein revenue spikes during peak travel seasons, thus indicating that this could be a good time for strategic pricing.
